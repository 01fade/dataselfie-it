                    <p>When you install the Data Selfie browser extension, it will run in the background as you use Facebook on your desktop. Data Selfie will record your interactions on the platform. The extension will record: clicks on likes in your newsfeed, clicks on newsfeed links to external sites, duration spent on different posts and the specifics of those posts (authors, images and text) in your newsfeed, anything you type, and time spent on Facebook overall. The more you use Facebook the more data is recorded. You can look at the Data Selfie dashboard and get a sense of what Facebook could know about your personality based on this data. The extension shows predictive analytics and insights by using machine learning APIs: <a href="https://applymagicsauce.com/">Apply Magic Sauce</a> and <a href="https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/?category=watson">IBM Watson</a>. So, part of the tracked data needs to be processed on the server, in order to so it is sent without any indicators, like name or Facebook ID, that are tied to you to the Data Selfie server.

                    <p>Your data is stored locally on your own computer. The Data Selfie server does not keep a data base of user data. It only passes the necessary data to the APIs - without your personal information such as name, gender, etc. The third-party services might log or store anonymized data or use the results to improve their services, but again they can't identify you as you, as no data about you specifically is sent along.

                        We use two machine learning API services:
                        <br>
                        <br> &nbsp;1. We are using the <a href="https://applymagicsauce.com/">Apply Magic Sauce API</a> that uses Facebook Like ID’s to predict a users psycho-demographic traits based on their digital footprints. You can learn more in the <a href="https://applymagicsauce.com/documentation.html">Apply Magic Sauce API documentation</a>.
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        <br> &nbsp;2. We are using <a href="https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/?category=watson">IBM Watson</a>. Specifically we are using the Personality Insights and Alchemy API. We may use the Visual Recognition and Language Translation in further releases.

                        <br> For the IBM machine learning, we have "opted out" so that the requests from the Data Selfie server are not logged and not used for training their models.

                    <p>Data Selfie is a free tool that is funded by grants. In order to keep costs in check, we have to limit the daily API calls so that as many people as possible can use Data Selfie. We hope people will be nice and courteous to the community so that Data Selfie can be available for all. Updated predictions will depend on your Facebook usage and depend on whether or not there is significant change to your data that makes a new predictions plausible.

                        <p>Data Selfie is not using Facebook’s API. The extension looks at the rendered front-end (the DOM) of the user's Facebook page in the browser – the HTML elements and their content – and with JavaScript the browser extension can detect when you scroll, when you type and when you click something.

                        <p>The extension will ask you for the following permissions: “Read and change your data on api.dataselfie.it and facebook.com” and “Manage your downloads”. The extension needs to be able to monitor activity on facebook.com and change some interface elements, so the user can receives feedback of what is tracked. api.dataselfie.it is the url to make requests for prediction; this permission is necessary in order to communicate with the Data Selfie server and APIs. “Manage your downloads” is for backing up your data into one single file on your computer.

                        <p>We recognize that the vast majority of social media usage is done on a mobile device. From the beginning of this project we explored making a mobile version. However, there is no way for us to access Facebook’s native mobile application. (And that is a good thing!) Therefore, the only way to make a mobile version would be to launch our own browser as a native application and implement Data Selfie features. We feel that this approach is not in line with our mission of providing good user experience design. Thus, we have no intention of making a mobile version.
