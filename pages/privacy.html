                    <p>Data Selfie is a way for you to have your consumption data on facebook.com analyzed. In order to do so the extension tracks: clicks on likes in your newsfeed, clicks on newsfeed links to external sites, duration spent on different posts and the specifics of those posts (authors, images and text) in your newsfeed, anything you type, and time spent on Facebook overall. </p>
                    <p>The permissions that the extension is asking for is for local (on your machine) data processing and sending anonymous requests to the Data Selfie server (from now on only referred to as "the server). That means the above mentioned data is sent, without your identity (like your name or Facebook ID), to the server and the analysis (e.g. personality prediction) is sent back to you, the user. No records (no data base, no logs) are kept on the server of your sent data (input) nor your analysis results (output). The server keeps your IP address for 24 hours to make sure nobody abuses the server with too many requests.</p>
                    <p>In total there are 4 different requests to the Data Selfie server with predicted analysis results being sent back to the user's extension.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Alchemy API, to process keywords, entities, concepts

                                <li>- All texts from the posts you have looked at/spent time on in your feed are sent to the server as one string of text.</li>
                                <li>- This is data does not include any identifier that makes the user personally identifiable (e.g. name, Facebook ID/profile link).</li>

                    <p>Data Selfie is not using Facebook’s API. The extension looks at the rendered front-end (the DOM) of the user's Facebook page in the browser – the HTML elements and their content – and with JavaScript the browser extension can detect when you scroll, when you type and when you click something.</p>
                    <p>Data Selfie provides Facebook users with (1) the kind of data Facebook could be tracking about them and (2) the kind of personality insights Facebook could be generating on them by using machine learning algorithms. This is not an effort to reverse engineer or replicate Facebook's algorithm, it's only an attempt to show what is possible with available algorithms.</p>
